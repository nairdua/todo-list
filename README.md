# Todo List+

It is said that every aspiring front-end developer has, or will have, created a "Todo List".
This is one such iteration of the coveted Todo List, but it will have a few nice features:

- Persisting todos to local storage
- A scratchpad (also persisted to local storage)

## Notice

This is a work in progress.
